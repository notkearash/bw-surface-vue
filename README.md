---
For my very first experience of working with VueJS (version 3), I decided to mock a landing page for one of Surface products called "Surface Pro X". Here is a screenshot of it:

## Notes
+ Dirty and quick project (I've wrote it in 2 days)
+ Probably turn it into TypeScript (I don't think so)
+ But still reusable
